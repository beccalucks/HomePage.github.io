I had made an attempted tooltip function in my static website but had run out of time to get it laid out well or working how I'd envisioned. I figured that I would improve on that work I'd already done with CSS because my javascript was already getting very complicated at that point. As I adress in my documentation, I was unable to make this section fully responsive. However, considering how much I've improved on this skill since the ugly tool I created for my static website, I am proud of the final product. It works perfectly and is legible in a full chrome browser, but is a little awkward on a smaller screen. I targetted each and every element and the whole footer in my media query, but no luck. -->
          <div class="tooltip"><p1>#BlackLivesMatter</p1>
            <span class="tooltiptext">What #BlackLivesMatter refers to as its “Herstory” began in 2013 with three activists and women of colour: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. They waned to build an organization to respond to the racist decision to acquit George Zimmerman who murdered Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012.
              Today, the organization has over 40 formal chapters and hundreds of thousands of marchers and active social media participants. Black Lives Matter Activists have engaged in actions and media events across America in response to the murders and judicial injustices suffered by Tamir Rice, Tanisha Anderson, Mya Hall, Walter Scott, Sandra Bland and Mike Brown (among far too many others).
              Participants spoke out and promoted conversation about the need for change in community-police relations and inherent racism from police and institutionalized in the whole legal system. People also have been using the organization’s platform to provide support for grieving families and allow dialogue between communities of colour all across the country to discuss ways to bring up their communities and get safety and justice for their sons and daughters. Protest and peaceful organizing turned into a nightmare scenario in Charlottesville when an alt-right, Nazi and KKK rally interrupted a Black Lives Matter and anti-Nazi protest and a white supremacist drove a vehicle through a thick crowd. Many were injured and a young activist named Heather Heyer was killed.

          <div class = "tooltip2"><p2>#AllLivesMatter</p2>
            <span class = "tooltiptext2">#AllLivesMatter is a movement in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which is an attempt to draw attention to the Black and Brown lives lost by police shooting and the racism within the U.S. criminal justice system. Many white people, misinterpreting the intent of the Black Lives Matter movement and operating under rumours and assumptions about riots and violence at the organization’s events. Although property damage and at times violence have   occurred during Black Lives Matter events, the group has never advocated for or taken credit for any of these tactics. However, a significant portion of the public considers the movement to be a terrorist group, and in fact the Trump administration has created a department within the FBI solely dedicated to tracking and policing Black Lives Matter meetings and events. Another hashtag, #BlueLivesMatter, is included in the twitter list for this movement. “Blue Lives” refers to American Police’s blue uniforms and makes the argument that the members of police forces that die on duty are being forgotten. Neither #BlueLivesMatter nor #AllLivesMatter are direct answers or challenges to the stated purpose of #BlackLivesMatter, but rather tangential arguments that other groups are being left out of the conversation about people of colour being unfairly targeted by law enforcement. Similar reactions to feminist and LGBTQ+ movements have been popular, such as the reaction “Not all men!” in response to women talking about being sexualised or harassed. #NotAllMen became a hashtag as well, of course!

            <div class = "tooltip3"><p3>#WaterIsLife</p3>
              <span class = "tooltiptext3">The #WaterIsLife movement is part of a larger sacred fight by the Indigenous American People to reclaim land that was stolen violently from them via the settlement of white Europeans and the displacement of the native peoples and long history of terrible violence against them. Specifically, the phrase Water Is Life comes from the Sioux mantra “Mni Wiconi” which conveys that water is the source of all things living, necessary for the plains and the bison and the people alike to sustain life. It has become a rallying cry for one of the most influential and widespread international political protests of all time. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an oil pipeline which threatens the water source of a Lakota Sioux reservation for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, located near Canon Ball in North Dakota. In the largest gathering to protest native rights in American history, native people and their allies from all over the world converged at Standing Rock to draw media and international attention to their right for clean water and their cultural right to their ancestral lands (the proposed pipeline would cross under the Missouri River and run through Native Burial Grounds). Standing Rock Sioux Chief David Archambault II, or Tokala Ohitika in Lakota, has been the official voice for the tribe as they have negotiated many legal battles and logistical concerns during the 2016 mass occupation of the land. However, the movement was started by a number of young indigenous activists, who felt compelled by an ancient Lakota prophecy and a youthful energy and ability to navigate U.S. bureaucracy. Notable among these are Dallas Goldtooth, who is now an organizer for an organization called Keep It In The Ground, a part of the Indigenous Environmental Network. Many activists like Red Fawn are still dealing with legal battles because of standing up to increasingly violent police. Reports coming back from the camp were inconsistent and confusing, but we now know that both Morton County police and private backup forces used tactics like water cannons in frozen weather, rubber bullets and tear gas canisters on peaceful protestors. There were many injuries, some permanent, and numerous fatalities. The occupiers, who called themselves water protectors rather than protestors, persevered regardless. They were victorious when, after surviving through most of a long and harsh winter, the Army Corps of Engineers denied permits to energy companies to drill under the river under the Obama Administration. However, one of Trump’s first actions in office was to reverse that decision. Drilling is currently underway, but the Sioux and their many friends are still fighting this battle in the courts and the media. Don’t completely discount the strong bonds and allyships that were forged on Sioux land at Standing Rock; the fight against the DAPL is not over.

                <div class = "tooltip4"><p4>#MeToo</p4>
                  <span class = "tooltiptext4">The #MeToo movement began in 2006 when a woman named Tarana Burke started using the phrase ‘me too’ to raise awareness about the frequency of sexual abuse, particularly targeting women of colour like her. She spoke of "empowerment through empathy”, particularly within underprivileged communities. Burke works towards a future where women would feel empowered to speak about their experiences to work towards change. More recently, actress Alyssa Milano suggested on twitter in October of 2017 that people who have been victims of sexual abuse and/or assault identify themselves using the hashtag #metoo. The magnitude of the problem continues to be highlighted through millions of women and men across the world sharing their stories. Additionally, there are practically daily revelations of alleged assaulters and abusers in Hollywood, the media, and politics. Notably, Ashley Judd was among tens of accusers of major film producer Harvey Weinstein who has been fired and is facing prosecution. Actor Kevin Spacey has been accused of assault and abuse by multiple people including fellow actor Anthony Rapp, who claims the assault happened when Rapp was just 14 years old. Roy Moore, who was accused of rape and assault by many women, barely lost the Alabama Senate special election in December 2017. Lately, many actresses and actors and others in the entertainment industry have created an organization called Time’s Up, referring to time being up on silence and victim blaming and stigmas surrounding speaking up about sexual crimes. The non-profit is focused on tangible solutions and resources for women and men in all industries dealing with harassment and assault in the workplace. A reckoning this has surely been, and only time will tell how far this cultural awakening will take U.S. society towards a more balanced and safe place for people of all gender expressions and sexualities.

                    <div class = "tooltip5"><p5>#MakeAmericaGreatAgain</p5>
                        <span class = "tooltiptext5">#MakeAmericaGreatAgain was the main rallying cry during the Presidential Campaign of Donald J. Trump, who became the GOP nominee after beating out a pool of eleven other Republicans in the primaries. Many people shouted the phrase along with “Lock Her Up!” referring to the alleged crimes of his opponent Hilary Clinton (who Trump called “Crooked Hilary”). These examples of extreme rhetoric and exaggerated solutions fell among plans to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and ban people from Muslim countries into the U.S. to stem the flow of immigration from specific places. Many people on all sides of the political debate and in countries all over the world spoke out in protest against these policy suggestions, and the campaign and Trump’s subsequent first year in office have been fraught with scandal, connections to the KKK and the alt-right and other white supremacists, fringe ideas and conspiracy theorists like Steve Bannon, accusations of collusion with Russia, and personal accusations of sexual assault and harassment against Trump himself. Yet through it all, a core group of Trump enthusiasts has stayed loyal to their populist leader, claiming since the beginning that Trump “tells it like it is.” Trump’s apparent ability to speak to a very specific demographic, mostly working-class and poor white people and very wealthy CEO’s and individuals who are also white people, in a way that they could relate to provided him with enough success at his self-aggrandizing rallies to bring him victory. As President, he continues to appeal almost exclusively to this narrow base that got him elected. He even still sells the red “Make America Great Again” hats that were so popular and divisive during election season. The most notable and important aspect of #MAGA, of course, is the use of twitter and other social media platforms to spread his message. By constantly updating his followers of his every whim via Twitter, Trump redefined campaign strategy. Everyone in politics knew that embracing social media was an increasingly important aspect of campaigning, but Trump took the concept to its extreme; he used the platform by turn as a thinktank for extreme policy thoughts and ideas and a way to target his perceived enemies with insults and bullying. His legion of followers loyally retweeted his thoughts and scoured social media to troll progressives and convince more people to join the #MAGA army. We now know, too, that domestic and foreign bots had a lot of influence on these hashtags as well.

                          <div class = "tooltip6"><p6>#LoveTrumpsHate</p6>
                            <span class = "tooltiptext6">#LoveTrumpsHate, along with #Resist, #NotMyPresident, and others are social hashtags in response to the upset election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th U.S. President. Many Americans and political spectators around the globe are in opposition to the divisive campaign Trump ran, during which he basically argued that immigration, Black people, Islam and Mexicans were to blame for America having become a “loser.” Essentially he spoke of deporting or discrediting or disenfranchising all those groups to allow for a return to a supposed time of American Greatness. The resistance to this notion is widespread and robust, and a newfound rigor and energy in progressive movement has blocked many of the Trump Administration’s attempts to carry out their plans, including building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, banning Islamic immigrants, overturning the Affordable Care Act (better known as its nickname ObamaCare). However, Trump has successfully gotten oil to flow through the Dakota Access Pipeline (read about #WaterIsLife to understand the indigenous fight against it) and just recently passed his highly controversial tax bill. He has also appointed a significantly higher number of judges just a year into office than former President Obama did. In spite of these losses, the fragmented left seems united in its goal of ousting Trump from office and doing everything in its power in the meantime to block him at every turn. The November elections were a sweep of power for the Democrats that no one predicted to be so strong. They included major upsets like Danica Roem, an openly transgender woman, beating the man who called himself “Virginia’s chief homophobe” and proposed a so-called bathroom bill restricting transgender people from using public restrooms fitting their gender identity. And the president continues to face backlash for his actions both domestically and beyond the U.S. borders. Numerous world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have spoken out against numerous actions taken by Trump such as his decision to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. Opposition is building and organizing in many different ways against Trump as his popularity ratings drop below that of any modern President at this point in his term.
